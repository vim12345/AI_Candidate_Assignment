# Task Details:
# Task 1:
• Create a simple content classifier using “Top 15 Anime And K-Drama Like True Beauty Webtoon” as inspiration. Develop a basic script that classifies webtoon descriptions into categories (e.g., romance, action, fantasy) using Python and scikit-learn.

o Implement a basic model (e.g., decision tree or logistic regression) to classify the categories and show the output.

# Task 2:

• Perform a basic sentiment analysis on user comments for “The Difference Between Manga And Manhwa”. Use a simple rule-based approach or the TextBlob library to identify whether comments are positive or negative.
